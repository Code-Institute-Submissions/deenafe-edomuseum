                <p class="flex-info">

                    The Musuem is located within the walls of the Oba's palace in the heart of the ancient city
                    of Benin Nigeria.
                </p>

                <p class="flex-info">

                    The musuem has on display, an array of pre-historic ancient and contemporary artworks that reflect
                    the
                    rich heritage of the Benin Kingdom.
                </p>

                <p class="flex-info">

                    The art works that populate the musuem consists of Benin bronze artefcats repatriated from the
                    United
                    Kingdom
                    and Germany which have tremendous signifance to the culture and history of the ancient Benin
                    Kingdom.
                    The repatriated artifacts are part of thousands of tusks, exceptional ivory objects, bronzes and
                    other
                    religious and ceremonial items
                    which was removed from the Benin-city in the aftermath of the British invasion in 1897.

                </p>

                <p class="flex-info">

                    Due to increased pressure on the Britian and other European countries to return artifacts acquired
                    during the colonial era, agreement are in place in repatriate hundreds more of the Benin bronzes and
                    the items will be received and kept by the The Edo Musuem of West African Art.
