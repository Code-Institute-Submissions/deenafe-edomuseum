## General Information

**EMOWAA** is an illustrative website about a museum that houses a collection of artefacts and imagery (primarily Bronze and copper carvings from the ancient Benin Kingdom). Although, the museum only exists presently as an idea/proposal, this website aims to provide insight on a probable collection of artefacts to be housed in the hypotehtical museum.

The website also aims to serve as a guide to the structural layout of the museum and provide a platform which guests can have a sneak preview of the collection of artefacts on display and schedule a tour of the museum. View the live site [here]( https://deenafe.github.io/edomuseum/)

## Testing   

***

   ### Responsiveness   
     All the pages were tested for responsiveness on various device screens ranging from 280px and above
    
    The website is responsive on the following devices:

  ###  Accessibility  
     To ensure that the website meets the WCAG Web Accessibilty Standards, [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to the results of the accessibility testing showed that the following were met:

     * There were no color contrast errors in all the pages.
     * The heading elements are properly structured to facilitate page navigation for users of assistive technologies.
     * All form labels are present and associated with a form control.
     * The HTML lang arrtibute is present to allow screen readers to read the content appropriately.
     * Images and external links have associated alternative text and aria-labels to be read by screen readers.

     The objective of performing the accessibility testing was to ensure the website is:

     * Perceivable
     * Operable
     *Understandable
     *Robust

    However, due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct the manual testing for accessibility using a screen reader.
